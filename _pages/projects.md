Here are some of the projects that I have done along with the research experience I have. They are a mixture of course projects, technical projects and self-learning projects.
# Research #

### Video Object Detection ###

Currently, I am involved in this research and working on writing it as a publication. In real life, we have sources like helicopters that have vibrating surface (due to engine) and rotating blades. These motions induce a sinusoidally varying frequency in the RADAR signal along with the body Doppler. If we can estimate these frequencies we can even tell the frequency of vibration of the engine and the angular speed of the blades. Our task is, given a signal, we need to estimate the values of the micro-doppler and body-doppler frequencies. For more information please refer to my [resume](http://shaan3130.github.io/files/resume.pdf). Soon after completion, I would provide with whole documentation.
