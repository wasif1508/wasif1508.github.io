A Brief Introduction
======

Hi everyone!! I am a junior undergraduate majoring in Electrical Engineering from the [Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur](https://iitk.ac.in). I belong to the beautiful city of [Ranchi](https://www.google.com/search?gs_ssp=eJzj4tTP1TcwLCkpMTNg9GIrSsxLzsgEADbMBcg&q=ranchi&oq=Ranch&aqs=chrome.1.69i57j46l2j0l2j46j0.1454j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8) in the heartland of Jharkhand. Since always I had a knack for Mathematics and anything that involves it fascinates me a lot.

A Personal Assessment
======

I am a very quick learner and a highly goal oriented person. I set out my day with daily targets and complete them howsoever long they may take, if I finish early, I take out the remaining time as a reward and enjoy myself to the fullest during it. I am very open and enthusiastic towards learning new ideas and I am always on the lookout for opportunities of deploying these ideas to solve real life problems.

My Interests
======
My interests can be broadly summarised into:
* Signal Processing
* Algorithms
* Machine Learning 
* Statistics

I routinely participate in various Competetive Programming contests and you can find me on:
